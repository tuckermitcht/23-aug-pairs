# Instructions for the Spooky Memory Game

When you click the start button, the game timer will start, and you will be presented with 12 cards, all turned face down. Clicking a card will reveal the image on the face of the card. Each turn consists of clicking on two cards. If the cards are a match, they will stay turned up. If they are not a match, they will turn back around. Keep clicking on cards to find matching pairs. The game ends when you've found all six pairs. At the end of the game, you will be presented with the time it took you to find all six pairs. Good luck!
